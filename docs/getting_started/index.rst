Getting Started
===============

Spack Monitor (spackmon) will allow you to programatically interact with a database
to keep track of your spack builds. This means that we store entire configurations
with package specs, along with error and output for the builds. The guide
here should walk you through basic usage of spackmon. If you have other questions
or find something missing, please `let us know <https://github.com/spack/spackmon/issues>`_
We recommend that you start by :ref:`getting-started_install`, which includes
specifics for starting with containers.
