# CHANGELOG

This is a manually generated log to track changes to the repository for each release. 
Each section should include general headers such as **Implemented enhancements** 
and **Merged pull requests**. All closed issued and bug fixes should be 
represented by the pull requests that fixed them. Critical items to know are:

 - renamed commands
 - deprecated / removed commands
 - changed defaults
 - backward incompatible changes


## [main](https://github.com/spack/spack-monitor/tree/main) (main)
 - second version after that (2.0.0)
 - first version that has specs before September 2021 (1.0.0)
 - skeleton release (0.0.0)
