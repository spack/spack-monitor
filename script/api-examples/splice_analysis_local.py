# This is an example for doing a splicing (preliminary) analysis LOCALLY to make
# a prediction about whether a package will build or not. This means:
# 1. Starting with a package of interest
# 2. Getting all specs for that package
# 3. For each spec, finding all the dependencies with install file and symbolator results
# 4. Doing a diff between the working symbol space and the anticipated symbol space
# 5. Making a prediction based on not having new missing symbols!

# USAGE: python splice_analysis_local.py <pkg>
# If no package is provided as an argument, we default to curl.
# Unlike splice_analysis.py, this uses API endpoints to download data locally
# first, and then do analysis from that.
