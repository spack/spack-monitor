# upload_save_local is an example of taking a directory created by spack
# with spack install --monitor --monitor-save-local singularity
# and uploading to a spack monitor server. This is a use case where you might
# have results generated where you don't have internet access or otherwise
# don't want to or cannot interact with spack monitor. This is an API endpoint
# so you are still required to have authentication.
# meaning you should export your username and token
#
# export SPACKMON_TOKEN=xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
# export SPACKMON_USER=thebestdude
